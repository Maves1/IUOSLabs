We know that the algorithm removes the oldest page, so in order to maximize the number of misses
we can make the number of pages bigger than the number of frames and call them sequentially (this one is not necessary,
but I decided to do it this way)
The example test:
2 5
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 1
5 2
This test will have 0 hits
